# About this project
Project code responsible for the simulation is not commited here - the only files we were able to edit for this project were the two in this repository. 

The project assumes the following;
	We have a high rise residential building, with a floor which recieves all residents mail.
	The building has two delivery robots that have a limited carry capacity (4 items) and limited maximum item weight that they may carry. 
	All mail has a weight and priority
	We are given some delivery costing function, f(priority, time taken to deliever)
	Mail arrives randomly

The problem the code solves is;
	*Define robot pair behaviour that minimizes the given cost function*

The project brief is included in pdf format for further detail
